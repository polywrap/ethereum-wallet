1- use a generic:
   - `class MyGeneric<T> { ... }``
   - this will make that, when conusming it, you need
   to pass the implemented trait as argument (turbofish)
2- trait object: Box<dyn Trait> or Arc<dyn Trait>

- the main difference to use which one is that trait object
accepts (or its easier) to interact with different implemetnations
of the trait, with the generic one you can just pass one
